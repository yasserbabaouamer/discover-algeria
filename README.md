## 4. Reflection

This project was built to obtain a bachelor's degree in software engineering, Project goals was:

- **Showcasing Algerian Cities and Tourist Attractions**
    
    Highlighting Algeria's cities and tourist attractions with detailed information.
    
- **Facilitating Travel Planning for Visitors**
    
    Providing a platform for travelers to find and book hotels, tours, and services.
    
- **Empowering Local Stakeholders**
    
    Enabling local stakeholders, such as accommodation owners and touristic agencies, to contribute and enhance the platform.
    

We chose **Django** for the backend due to its productivity, built-in features, powerful ORM, and extensive libraries, making development efficient and straightforward.

**React** was selected for its reliable code, robust design, component-based architecture, and strong community support, ensuring a smooth and responsive user interface.

## Challenges Faced

### Implementing a Fast Search Algorithm with Recommendations

I needed a fast and efficient search algorithm with recommendation features. Starting with the Levenshtein algorithm in Python, I found it too slow. I then moved to a PL/SQL implementation, but it still wasnâ€™t fast enough. Finally, I wrote the algorithm in C and used it as a User-Defined Function (UDF) in the database, achieving a dramatic performance boost. The query time improved from 1.1 seconds (PL/SQL) to 0.009 seconds (C UDF), making it 122x times faster. tested on a table with over 2100 indexed records.

### Designing an innovative authentication flow

I developed a comprehensive authentication flow that seamlessly integrates the signup, login, account confirmation, and password reset processes. The diagram illustrates this flow in detail. [link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1y58gcR33Mlc4A6VeoGFvjwr6mwDlYE_3/view?usp=sharing)

**Why I chose this approach:**

- **Unified System**: This flow ensures a consistent authentication experience across the entire platform, eliminating the need to design separate flows for each feature or user type.
- **Simplified Maintenance**: By having a single, unified authentication flow, maintaining and updating the system becomes easier and less error-prone.
- **Security**: A unified flow allows for more robust and centralized security measures, ensuring that all aspects of authentication are handled with the same level of scrutiny and protection.
- **Consistency**: Having a standardized process ensures that all users follow the same steps, making the system more predictable and reliable.
- **Enhanced User Experience**: Users benefit from a streamlined process, reducing confusion and improving their overall experience on the platform.

### Managing Multiple Profiles with the Same Email and Password

I tackled the challenge of allowing users to manage multiple profiles (guest, host, touristic agency owner) with the same email and password.

- **Profile Identification**: Implemented dynamic routing to direct users to the correct profile based on the login endpoint.
- **Data Segregation**: Designed a database schema to logically separate user data while maintaining a single account for login.
- **Role-Specific Permissions**: Integrated a role-based access control system to adjust features based on the user's profile.

### Managing complex queries and filters

The system required numerous complex queries and filters to deliver detailed statistics and results. Initially, I struggled with writing multiple subqueries in Django, as they were hard to manage. That's when I discovered the [django-sql-utils](https://github.com/martsberger/django-sql-utils) package. This package greatly simplified the process, making it easier to write subqueries and handle conditions within them, streamlining the development of complex queries.

 ## 5. Project Status
 **Alpha Version**: This project is currently in the alpha version. We are actively working on it and plan to add new features in the future.
